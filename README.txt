To start run

npm install

Then run

node server.js

This will start the app on your localhost:3000

Project Implements mongoDB using a collection called Messages and a document called Messages
You can use your own database for this by creating a free mongoDB cluster to reference and creating
a collection and document both called Messages

I am currently hosting this app with heroku so you can do this too by creating a heroku project following their
instructions and then creating a .env file for the mongoDB uri and a secret on heroku for the mongoDB uri when hosting.
